1: setup raspicam
2: setup netcam from opencv images
3: create a navigator
4: create a threaded publish-subscribe for sensor-values to the main-loop
5:



Problems to solve:

Threading sensors loop and reporting using last known values from main-loop
PWM control for motors
Sensorfusion? How to define obstacles etc
Navigator strategies
Mechanical design of Lego-bricks for sensors
Save 'mapdata' from a room?


Separate sensors and awareness, the robot needs to be aware of obstacles, direction, speed etc
Awareness-module is in turn using some sensors to

driving direction
driving speed
obstacle-map {front:
